# 🌟 Great Sage

## ✨ Introduction

Welcome to **Great Sage**, a modern Socratic tool designed to uncover the essence of personality traits through text and handwriting analysis. Inspired by the probing questions of Socrates and grounded in modern psychological research, Great Sage uses innovative techniques to provide deep insights into individuals' personalities and preferences.

## 🛠️ Features

### 📝 1. Text Analysis for Personality Insights

Great Sage evaluates the use of functional words in texts to reveal aspects of an individual’s personality. This feature draws on principles from the book “The Secret Life of Pronouns” to uncover underlying traits and behavioral tendencies.

### ✍️ 2. Handwriting Analysis

Using advanced image processing and analysis, Great Sage can interpret handwriting to infer details about an individual’s personality. Handwriting speaks volumes about the writer, and this feature unlocks those insights.

### 🎵 3. Music Genre Inference

Based on text and conversational inputs, Great Sage can make educated guesses about your favorite genre of music. These inferences add another dimension to understanding your preferences and personality.

### 💬 4. Behavioral Concept Conversations

Engage with Great Sage in conversations about behavioral and psychological concepts. This feature provides an interactive way to explore your personality, akin to having a modern ChatGPT-like experience.
